i Want to build a music streamer web app. main purpouse is enable the user to have a beautiifull userfrendly modern music steamer ui, where they can start playing music on their speakers (i.e Sonos)

in the first generateion it will only work with sonos and have a sonos integration.

#app flow: 
1. users open as app, on when no music streaming service is configurated the user will be taken to the conifuguration page here the user will be ablo to sign in to their Sonos account (in the feature different others as well, mutliple service will be supported at the same time)
2. when a steaming service is connected the user should be taken to their "my music page" here they will see their favorit playlists, podcasts etc with almubart titles etc.
3. when user selects something to play it should bring up a beafifull musicplayer with needed controls almbumart info etc in full screeen.


#techstack:
- nextjs 16
- shadcn components
- primsa with sql lite.
- intgration with sonos so they can start playing music on their speakers / zones etc.
- responsive so looks good on all device types.
- no auth to app it self
